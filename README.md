# NBA-Momentum-Grapher
A graph utility tool for mapping momentum in NBA games

The momentum of NBA games is an interested topic of discussion. Thus, I have made a python utility that takes a csv file (e.g. the one I have used in this example is a season's worth of data about each ball posession of each game in the season). The utility will then make a graph of the momentum in the game.

I am still working on a nicer gui and better tools for this project, so it is definitely still in the works. But, it can begun to be tested and experimented on.
